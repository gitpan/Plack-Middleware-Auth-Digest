DESCRIPTION
    Plack::Middleware::Auth::Digest is a Plack middleware component that
    enables Digest authentication. Your "authenticator" callback is given an
    username as a string and should return a password, either as a raw
    password or a hashed password.

CONFIGURATIONS
    authenticator
        A callback that takes an username and returns a password for the
        user, either in a plaintext password or a MD5 hash of
        "username:realm:password" (quotes not included) when
        "password_hashed" option is enabled.

    password_hashed
        A boolean (0 or 1) to indicate whether "authenticator" callback
        returns passwords in a plaintext or hashed. Defaults to 0
        (plaintext).

    realm
        A string to represent the realm. Defaults to *restricted area*.

    secret
        Server secret text string that is used to sign nonce. Required.

    nonce_ttl
        Time-to-live seconds to prevent replay attacks. Defaults to 60.
